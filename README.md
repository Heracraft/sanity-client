Sanity client for running GROQ queries.  Handy for quickly running queries against different Sanity datasets/projects.

Designed to function like [@sanity/vision](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/vision) without an auth wall plus a tab interface. 

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [react18-json-view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react18-json-view) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

**Comming soon**
- ~~GROQ syntax highlighting~~: Wont be added, current setup is good enough. Checkout the [syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/Heracraft/sanity-client/tree/syntax-highlighting) branch for ealry work on this.
