This is an imitation of the [Sanity Vision tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sanity/vision) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [react18-json-view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react18-json-view) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Handy for quickly running queries against different Sanity datasets/projects.
